# apatton-password-generator

## Description
    I was tasked through the acceptance criteria to build a password generator.
    It needed to prompt the user to gain input to add to the password that they
    will want to generate. This included uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
    I was tasked to use Java Script methods, and prompts to achieve this goal.



    


## Usage
    After adding the Java Script you are now able to be prompted through
    a set of questions to create a new password.
